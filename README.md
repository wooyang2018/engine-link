# EngineLink

🌐 [enginelink.dev](https://enginelink.dev)

**Cursor-first Unreal Engine build bridge** — build, launch, and live-code UE projects with AI-powered tooling.

EngineLink connects [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) to Unreal Engine so you can compile, iterate, and debug C++ projects without leaving your editor. It auto-detects your `.uproject`, discovers engine installations from the Windows registry, and exposes every build action to Cursor's AI agent via a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

> 🧪 **Status:** Early preview. Windows-only for now.

> 👋 **TL;DR:** I've been building software for 10 years but game dev is new to me. As I learn Unreal Engine, I found Rider and Visual Studio to be old-fashioned compared to modern AI-first editors — so I decided to give Cursor full UE capabilities. I'm testing this extension as I go, learning and breaking things along the way. Contributions and feedback are very welcome :)

## Setup Guide

Getting EngineLink running is a three-step process: install the system prerequisites, install EngineLink, then install the C/C++ extension for IntelliSense.

### Step 1 — System Prerequisites

You need **Windows**, **Unreal Engine**, and **Visual Studio** with the right components.

#### Unreal Engine 5.4+

Install via the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/). EngineLink has been tested on **UE 5.4 – 5.7**.

#### Visual Studio with C++ and Clang

Open **Visual Studio Installer**, click **Modify** on your install (Community / Build Tools / etc.), and make sure these components are enabled:

**Workload:**
- **Desktop development with C++** (this gives you MSVC, Windows SDK, and the core build tools UE needs)

**Individual Components** (search in the installer):
- **C++ Clang Compiler for Windows** — needed by UBT to generate `compile_commands.json` for IntelliSense
- **MSBuild support for LLVM (clang-cl) toolset** *(optional but recommended)*

> If you skip Clang, EngineLink will still build your project fine (UE uses MSVC), but `compile_commands.json` generation will fail and you won't get full IntelliSense. You can always add Clang later.

#### Cursor

Install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) (version `1.85.0` or later).

---

### Step 2 — Install EngineLink

**From Marketplace** — *coming soon.*

**From VSIX** — download or build the `.vsix`, then in Cursor: **Extensions → ... → Install from VSIX...**

**From Source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmoubayed/engine-link.git
cd engine-link
npm install
npm run build
```

Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host, or package it with `npm run package`.

---

### Step 3 — C/C++ for Cursor (IntelliSense — installed automatically)

EngineLink handles **building** your project, but you need a language server for **IntelliSense** (code completion, go-to-definition, diagnostics on the fly).

EngineLink is an **extension pack** that automatically installs **[C/C++ for Cursor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anysphere.cpptools)** — Cursor's official C/C++ extension. It adds LSP, debugging, and code browsing support using **clangd** under the hood. You don't need to install it separately.

#### Where `compile_commands.json` lives

UnrealBuildTool often writes the database next to the **engine** (e.g. `UE_5.7\compile_commands.json`). **EngineLink always copies it to your `.uproject` folder** as `compile_commands.json` at the **project root** after a successful run, so **clangd** can find it when you open files under `Source/` (it walks up to the workspace root).

If IntelliSense still cannot find the compilation database (e.g. generation failed or you use a non-standard layout), you can point clangd at the engine folder manually in **`.vscode/settings.json`**:

```json
{
  "clangd.arguments": [
    "--compile-commands-dir=C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.7"
  ]
}
```

Use the **directory** that contains `compile_commands.json`, forward slashes, then reload the window.

#### MSVC intrinsic false positives (builtin_definition)

When clangd parses UE code with MSVC-style headers, you may see **"definition of builtin function"** errors on system headers. This is a known clangd/MSVC quirk, not an error in your code — the real UE build is unaffected.

**EngineLink handles this automatically.** On activation it upserts a managed block in your project's `.clangd` file:

```yaml
# <<< enginelink-managed >>>
Diagnostics:
  Suppress: builtin_definition
# <<< end-enginelink-managed >>>
```

This only suppresses that one diagnostic class. EngineLink replaces only its own managed region and won't touch the rest of your `.clangd`. To disable: set `enginelink.upsertClangdConfig` to `false`.

---

## Quick Start

Once everything is installed:

1. Open a folder containing a `.uproject` file in Cursor
2. EngineLink activates automatically and:
   - Finds your `.uproject` and parses `EngineAssociation`
   - Discovers the matching UE installation from the registry
   - Locates VS Build Tools
   - Generates Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)
   - Generates `compile_commands.json` (if Clang is installed)
   - Creates/updates `.clangd` for MSVC suppression
3. The status bar shows your project name, engine version, and build actions
4. Press **`Ctrl+Shift+B`** to build

If auto-detection fails, override paths in [Configuration](#configuration).

## Features

### Build Integration

- **Build / Rebuild / Clean** — invoke UnrealBuildTool directly with full output streaming
- **Live Coding** (`Ctrl+Alt+F11`) — hot-reload in a running Unreal Editor session
- **Editor-aware builds** — detects when Unreal Editor is running and suggests Live Coding over a full build to avoid DLL lock errors
- **`compile_commands.json`** — auto-generates via UBT's `GenerateClangDatabase` mode
- **`.clangd` management** — suppresses MSVC/Clang `builtin_definition` false positives

### Auto-Detection

- **Project** — scans workspace for `.uproject` files, parses `EngineAssociation`
- **Engine** — reads Windows registry (launcher + source builds) and common paths
- **Build tools** — locates Visual Studio via `vswhere`

### Cursor AI Integration

- **MCP server** — exposes build, clean, rebuild, launch, live-coding, diagnostics, and project info as MCP tools. Tell Cursor *"build my project and fix any errors"* and it handles everything autonomously
- **Cursor rules** — generates `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files so the AI writes idiomatic Unreal C++

### Editor UX

- **Status bar** — project name, engine version, build config, and action buttons
- **Problems panel** — MSVC and UBT errors surfaced as native diagnostics
- **Progress notifications** — build progress via spinner and toast
- **Task provider** — `enginelink` tasks for the Tasks panel and `tasks.json`

## MCP Server (AI Agent Tools)

EngineLink ships a built-in MCP server that Cursor's AI agent can call directly. It's spawned on activation and registered in `.cursor/mcp.json`.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `enginelink_build` | Build (optional config/target overrides) |
| `enginelink_rebuild` | Clean + build |
| `enginelink_clean` | Clean build artifacts |
| `enginelink_get_build_errors` | Errors with file paths, lines, and messages |
| `enginelink_get_project_info` | Project name, engine version, modules, settings |
| `enginelink_launch_editor` | Launch Unreal Editor |
| `enginelink_live_coding` | Trigger Live Coding hot-reload |
| `enginelink_generate_compile_commands` | Regenerate `compile_commands.json` |

---

## Cursor Rules

On project detection, EngineLink generates `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files (never overwrites existing ones) so the AI follows UE conventions:

| Rule File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `unreal-conventions.mdc` | Class prefixes (`U`, `A`, `F`, `E`, `I`, `T`), PascalCase, UE types |
| `unreal-macros.mdc` | `UCLASS`, `UPROPERTY`, `UFUNCTION`, `USTRUCT`, `UENUM` |
| `unreal-build-system.mdc` | `.Build.cs`, `.Target.cs`, modules, plugins |
| `unreal-live-coding.mdc` | What Live Coding can and cannot hot-patch |
| `unreal-patterns.mdc` | Delegates, timers, subsystems, Gameplay Tags, Enhanced Input, logging |

> **This is where we need the most help.** If you're an experienced UE developer, your feedback on these rules would be incredibly valuable — please open an issue or PR!

---

## Task Provider

EngineLink registers an `enginelink` task type for `.vscode/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "enginelink",
      "action": "build",
      "configuration": "Development",
      "targetType": "Editor",
      "label": "EngineLink: Build Editor (Development)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Problem matchers `$enginelink-msvc` and `$enginelink-ubt` are included for parsing build output.
